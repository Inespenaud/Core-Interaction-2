        <p>This website explores the multiple styles of AI (artificial intelligence) generated art.
        <p>
        This art wass created on a website called Wombo where you select categories and art gerneated by AI from it.
        <p>
        For this particular project we typed in art and chose the category to create the art work.
        <p>
        This was a collaborative process, as there were two people involved in creating this collection of work.
        <p>
        The first person, the creator of the collection was Hannah, she created 50 AI art pieces which she filtered in their style.
        <p>
        Later on she passed the collection to me Ines, and I continued to create 50 more AI generated art pieces, sorting them into categories which became the ones used on the website.
        <p>
        This website aims to demonstrate a selection of multiple AI styles as a demonstration of the vastness that Artificial Intelligence within the art world.</p>
