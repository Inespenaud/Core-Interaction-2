                  On the rush-hour train one evening last summer, I looked
                  around at all the women in the carriage. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="text_2">
                  Because one day in our early lives as women, everything
                  changes.

                <p class="text_3" >
                  I'm in my mid-30s now and my periods have always been a
                  physical and mental slog. 
                </p>
  
                <p class="text_4">
                  I have spent years trying to gain autonomy over the way my
                  hormones seem to make my mind and body behave. 
                </p>
  
                <p class="text_5">
                  Instead, I was surprised by a growing sense of peace.
                  Addressing the patterns of my mood with a therapist, we looked
                  closely at the shame I attached to being sensitive, sad or
                  scared in the second half of my cycle and asked where it came
                  from. After researching anxiety, I started training to become
                  a psychologist and began researching hormones. I started to
                  see things in a way I never thought I would. I had a new
                  question, and that was: what am I seeking relief from?
                </p>
  
                <p class="text_6">
                  I've come to believe that greater awareness of our hormonal
                  processes can help us not only to manage our corresponding
                  moods, but also to conceptualise what a mood actually is: a
                  state of being that is, by its nature, temporary, and rarely
                  directly attributable to one thing. It's an interesting
                  dichotomy, that we can be quite disconnected from what's
                  actually going on when our hormones are fluctuating - when
                  oestrogen dramatically rises, for example, during ovulation -
                  and yet be so ready to self-police when we feel anything other
                  than sanguine and pain-free.

                <p class="text_7">
                  We blame so much on being “hormonal”: irrationality, “bad”
                  decision-making, angry outbursts, low self-esteem. That wasn't
                  the real me, we might think, agonising over a knee-jerk
                  decision we made at work, or taking offence at a throwaway
                  comment in the pub. It was my hormones. The same phrase could
                  cover everything from wanting to kill your partner at the
                  dinner table to having frantic sex with them on it.
