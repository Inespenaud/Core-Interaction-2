                  Plagiarism is the starting point of the creative activity in the new art.
      
                  Whenever the new art uses an isolated word, then it is in an absolute isolation: books of one single word.
                  
                  Old art’s authors have the gift for language, the talent for language, the ease for language.
                  
                  For new art’s authors language is an enigma, a problem; the book hints at ways to solve it.
                  
                  In the old art you write “I love you” thinking that this phrase means “I love you.”
                  
                  (But: what does “I love you” mean?)
                  
                  In the new art you write “I love you” being aware that we don’t know what this means. You write this phrase as part of a text wherein to write “I hate you” would come to the same thing.
                  
                  The important thing is, that this phrase, “I love you” or “I hate you,” performs a certain function as a text within the structure of the book.
                  
                  In the new art you don’t love anybody.
                  
                  The old art claims to love.
                  
                  In art you can love nobody. Only in real life can you love someone.</p></div>
                  
                  Not that the new art lacks passions.
                  
                  All of it is blood flowing out of the wound that language has inflicted on men.
                  
                  And it is also the joy of being able to express something with everything, with anything, with almost nothing, with nothing.
                  
                  The old art chooses, among the literary genres and forms, that one which best fits the author’s intention.
                  
                  <p>The new art uses any manifestation of language, since the author has no other intention than to test the language’s ability to mean something.</p>
              
                  The text of a book in the new art can be a novel as well as a single word, sonnets as well as jokes, love letters as well as weather reports.
                  
                  In the old art, just as the author’s intention is ultimately unfathomable and the sense of his words indefinable, so the understanding of the reader is unquantifiable.
                  
                  In the new art the reading itself proves that the reader understands.
                </p>
                <p class="pull-quote">The Reading</p>
                <p>
                  In order to read the old art, knowing the alphabet is enough.

                  In order to read the new art one must apprehend the book as a structure, identifying its elements and understanding their function.
                  
                  One might read old art in the belief that one understands it, and be wrong.
                  
                  Such a misunderstanding is impossible in the new art. You can read only if you understand.
                  
                  In the old art all books are read in the same way.
                  
                  In the new art every book requires a different reading.
                  
                  In the old art, to read the last page takes as much time as to read the first one.
                  
                  In the new art the reading rhythm changes, quickens, speeds up.
                  
                  In order to understand and to appreciate a book of the old art, it is necessary to read it thoroughly.
                  
                  In the new art you often do NOT need to read the whole book.
                  
                  The reading may stop at the very moment you have understood the total structure of the book.
                  
                  The new art makes it possible to read faster than the fast-reading methods.
                  
                  There are fast-reading methods because writing methods are too slow.
                  
                  The old art takes no heed of reading.
                  
                  The new art creates specific reading conditions.
                  
                  The farthest the old art has come to, is to bring into account the readers, which is going too far.
                  
                  The new art doesn’t discriminate between its readers; it does not address itself to the book-addicts or try to steal its public away from TV.
                  
                  In order to be able to read the new art, and to understand it, you don’t need to spend five years in a Faculty of English.
                  
                  In order to be appreciated, the books of the new art don’t need the sentimental and/ or intellectual complicity of the readers in matters of love, politic, psychology, geography, etc.
                  
                  The new art appeals to the ability every man possesses for understanding and creating signs and systems of signs.
